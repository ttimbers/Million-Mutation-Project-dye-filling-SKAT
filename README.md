# Million-Mutation-Project-dye-filling-SKAT

Genomic data and code to accompany the SKAT analysis of Million Mutation Project strains 
dye-filling phenotypes reported in Timbers et al.

All data used for this project is stored in a private repository on Figshare, which will 
be made public upon publication of the manuscript.

## Dependencies

`Bash Shell`, `Make`, `Perl`, `Plink v1.90b1g`, `R` and `R packages SKAT version 0.95, stringr, fdrtool`

## How to use it

1. Navigate the Shell to the root directory of the project.
2. Type `make`

### This code currently works, but the phenotype data has not yet been released. This
will be done very shortly.
